# Introduction
TODO: Give a short introduction of your project. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project. 
dbWave2 is a database-oriented electrophysiological analysis program developed to acquire and analyze recordings from taste and olfactory sensilla of insects. 
Each recording is stored along with descriptors which are read by dbWave and exported to a database. 
dbWave2 differs from dbWave1 in that it allows users to filter each filed on several criteria while dbwave (the original), allows only to filter on a single parameter.
