        Tools / Copy files to a new directory...

    <p>
        This menu item will enable you to save a database along with its data files into a
        single directory, located on the hard disk (by default, on C:\Temp), or on any
        other connected disk or USB key. dbWave will keep the same file directories
        structure than in the original data, and will update the database accordingly.
        The program will first ask you to choose a destination (it can be anywhere, and
        even could include subdirectories). Then it creates these directories and
        perform a binary copy of the data and spike files.
