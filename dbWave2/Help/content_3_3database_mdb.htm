        Database</h1>
    <p>
        A typical experiment includes hundreds or thousand of individual data files. 
        Each datafile saved by dbWave stores along with the primary data, descriptors 
        which can be read by dbWave. These descriptors are defined when you acquire data 
        or can be defined later. The dbWave database collects information from each of 
        these data files and builds a list of filenames, and descriptors which can be 
        handled interactively.</p>
    <p>
        Database files have the extension &quot;*.mdb&quot;. If dbwave crashes, it may leave a 
        file with a &quot;*.ldb&quot; extension. You can safely erase such files from your 
        directories.</p>
    <p>
        The database itself consists into a main table and accessory tables. Each row of 
        the main table corresponds to a single data file. The accessory tables store 
        indexed text descriptors. In the main table, only the indexes are stored, so 
        that the database is more compact.
