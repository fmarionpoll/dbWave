<h1>Introducing dbWave</h1>
<p>dbWave is designed to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href= "content_1_1datatranslation.htm">interface to data acquisition cards </a></li>
        <li><a href="content_1_3recordingsignals.htm">acquire data and save them into data files</a></li>
        <li><a href="content_1_2eventsdetection.htm">detect events such as spikes and perform basic measures that can be further 
            exported</a></li>
    </ul>

<p>Data acquisition cards convert electrical data into numbers which are stored in 
    the program into dbWave-specific data files (*.dat). dbWave allows to document these data files with information stored into the data files and into a database file (*.dbw). It provides tools to detect and sort spikes by amplitude (*.spk files) and to export these data to excel files, as a table and associated pivot tables.</p>

<p>dbWave is developped under Visual C++ using MFC objects and make extensive use of samples provided by Microsoft and by a number of authors who published and shared their work under CodeProject (http://www.codeproject.com/).</p>
