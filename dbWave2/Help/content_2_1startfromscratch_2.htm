        Click on the button &quot;Record&quot; or go through the menu &quot;View
        / Acquire data&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
        This should display the
        following central view:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img alt="acquisition view" class="style9"
             src="Images/scratch_screen1.jpg" />
    </p>
    <p>
        You should see the name of your data acquisition board on the the combo box
        facing the word &quot;board&quot;. As the DT9818 board has both A/D and D/A capabilities,
        dbWave also display a D/A capabilities section which is not present if your card
        does not have this feature. The central area of the screen will be used to
        display incoming data. By default, this screen will display consecutive 1 s
        sweeps.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can start right away to acquire data by hitting the button &quot;start&quot;, but you
        might also want to control your data acquisition settings (<a href="content_2_1startfromscratch_4.htm">sampling mode</a>) and (<a href="content_2_1startfromscratch_3.htm">input channels</a>) before
        starting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just under the button &quot;Start&quot;, make sure that you have selected &quot;Write to disk&quot;.
        If you have selected &quot;oscilloscope&quot;, the program will acquire data and display
        them on the screen but it will not save them to the disk.
