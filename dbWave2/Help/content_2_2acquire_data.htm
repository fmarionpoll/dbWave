                Press &quot;Start&quot; to begin an acquisition - the program will start acquiring data
                immediately or wait for an external event to occur (for example a TTL trigger).

                2 data acquisition
                modes are available:

                <br />
                - write to disk: save data to a file stored on a disk
                : if you select this option, before acquiring data, you will need to provide
                information about the experiment and the file where data should be stored.<br />
                - acquire data and display them on the screen. Data are not saved and cannot be
                used for anything else. This mode is useful when trying to impale a cell or
                checking the noise level of the system.

        <strong>Notes: </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Data are acquired as chunks of data, i.e. into consecutive arrays. Once an array
        has been filled by the A/D card, the card sends a message to the program which
        will then store the data on the disk and display it on a portion of the screen.
        If the card and the program cannot follow the sampling rate you need, try to
        enlarge the size of the buffers, reduce the number of buffers per sweep, and
        ultimately, disable the display.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ordinates and abcissa information are tentative and have not been thoroughfully
        checked.
    </p>
    <p>
        D/A operations are still under development.
