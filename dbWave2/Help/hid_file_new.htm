<P>Use this command to create a new document in dbWave.  Select the type of new file you want to create in the <A HREF="afx_hidd_newtypedlg.htm">File New dialog box</A>. </P>    <P>From this dialog box, you can create 2 types of documents: database and project.</P>    <ul>        <li>Database. <blockquote>            This is the preferred way. Upon creation, a database will be empty. You will be             able to add records either by importing data (or spike) files or by acquiring             data with a data acquisition card. The created database will be saved as a             document with an extension &quot;mdb&quot; which means it can be read by Microsoft Access             (until version 2007).</blockquote>        </li>        <li>Project&nbsp;            <blockquote>                This will open an empty view, into which you will be able to write or export                 file names that you will be able to save as a project file (*.prj). Project files                 contain text and are used to read filenames (each file is on a separate line).                 You can then open this list of files (*.dat or *.spk) from there. This provides                 a mechanism to import list of files from Excel for example.</blockquote>    </ul><P>You can open an existing document with the  <A HREF="hid_file_open.htm">Open command</A>.</P>
