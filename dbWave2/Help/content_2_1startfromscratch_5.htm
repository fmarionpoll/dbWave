        Define where data will be stored
    </h1>
    <p>
        Once you have defined the amplifier settings and the sampling parameters, you
        can hit the &quot;Start&quot; button (see screen shot <a href="scratch_screeen0.jpg">here</a>).
        This will launch the following dialog box.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img alt="Define data file" class="style5"
             src="Images/scratch_savefileas.jpg" />
    </p>
    <p>
        This dialog box defines where your data will be stored and how your data will be
        described in the database.
    </p>
    <p>
        Filename and path, define where data are stored. Data file names are composed of
        a root (for example &quot;data&quot;), to which is appended a number. This number will be
        automatically incremented each time this dialog box is called. If you need to
        acquire data in a quick succession, click &quot;acquire a series of files&quot; so that
        the dialog box is bypassed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other settings of this dialog box represent fields used in the database to
        describe your data. Currently, the list of fields is fixed. This information
        will be saved within the data file, into a header.
    </p>

    <p>
        Clicking &quot;<a href="content_2_1startfromscratch_6.htm">OK</a>&quot; will start the
        acquisition.
