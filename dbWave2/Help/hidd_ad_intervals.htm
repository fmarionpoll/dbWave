        resolution), what they will become, and how the data acquisition will start. It

                This set of parameters defines how fast you will sample incoming data.&nbsp; These
                parameters are critical if your memory resources are limited and if the
                computing resources are limited. <br />
                The 4 parameters in this box are related by the following formula:<br />
                <span class="style14">sweep_len = n_words * n_buffers / rate</span><br />
                For the same sweep length, if you have small buffers, the screen will be
                refreshed quickly and by small increments; if you define large buffers, you will
                have less buffers and the screen will be refreshed less frequently. Typically,
                we use 1 s = 1000 words x 10 buffers / 10 000 Hz.

                technical specifications of your A/D card. For many cards, the maximum sampling
                rate is given as the total number of data points that can be acquired per
                second. If you acquire data on 2 channels, the maximum sampling rate is divided
                by 2.

        These parameters will be saved when you exit the program. However, if you go to
        &quot;database&quot; and return to &quot;Record&quot;, the program will load the data acquisition
        parameters of the record that was selected in the database and erase your
        current parameters.
