        Cursor mode: Measure</h1>

    <p>
        This changes the cursor which has different functions depending on the view 
        mode:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>under <strong>data display mode</strong>, this cursor allows you to set cursors 
            on the view and to <strong>perform measurements</strong>, either of amplitude 
            between two horizontal cursors or at vertical cursors placed along the curve at 
            different time intervals. Whether it is in horizontal or vertical measuring 
            mode, is determined by parameters adjusted when you hit the yellow button on the 
            left of the toolbar.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;under <strong>spike detection mode</strong>, it allows you to <strong>
            define a stimulus</strong>, by placing vertical cursors on the curves which will 
            be interpreted as a stimulus signal going on and off. In order to add a stimulus 
            event, left click on the mouse where you want to add it. You can change this 
            later, either by moving the vertical cursor (in arrow mode, by clicking on it 
            and keeping it clicked, the cursor will move with our mouse cursor), or by 
            editing the stimulus series (in the menu &quot;Tools&quot; / &quot;Edit stimulus...&quot;).</li>
        <li>&nbsp;under <strong>spike edit mode</strong>, it allows you to either add new 
            spikes manually, or to change the spike class which is located at the vertical 
            of your cursor when you left-click the mouse. If you click in an area where 
            there are no spikes, it will create a new spike. If you click over a spike, it 
            will select that spike and change its class (according to the parameters you 
            have defined on that view). The program allows for some jitter in the placement 
            of the cursor, so that if you click the mouse in the vicinity of a spike, it 
            will select that spike and change its class . If you want to force the creation 
            of a spike, press &quot;Ctrl&quot; while you depress the left button of the mouse.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;this command (button) has no function under the other views (database, 
            spike sorting, spike templates, spike time series analysis, data acquisition).</li>
    </ul>
