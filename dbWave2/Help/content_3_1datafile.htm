        Data files</h1>
    <p>
        dbWave primary works with data files generated by dbWave or by other data 
        acquisition programs. dbWave data files have the &quot;*.dat&quot; extension.
    </p>
    <p>
        A typical data file contains a header describing the data acquired (date, time, 
        comments, additional descriptors) and the binary data generated by the 
        acquisition. Typically, these binary data are 16 bits words, and each 
        consecutive point correspond to the next time sample (if you sample one 
        channel). If you sample several channels, each consecutive point corresponds to 
        the next channel (from 0 to 15 for example), and the next one corresponds to the 
        next time sampling volley.</p>
