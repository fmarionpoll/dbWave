<h1>Analog-to-digital conversion</h1>
<p>In order to acquire data, you need a data acquisition card that converts 
    electrical signals into numbers.</p>

<p>dbWave is interfaced to Data Translation data acquisition cards through a generic driver 
    from Data Translation called DTOpenLayer.</p>
    <p>The driver is downloadable from DT website at
        <a href="http://www.datatranslation.com/cd/omni/">
        http://www.datatranslation.com/cd/omni/</a></p>
    <p>Basically, the driver is generic and provides the same program interface to a 
        program, which means that you can use dbWave with a whole line of data 
        acquisition cards. In our laboratory, we currently use USB cards called 
        multifunction cards of the DT9800 family.</p>
    <p>When you acquire data, you need to pay attention to 3 parameters:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>How fast you sample your data</strong>. This is called the sampling 
            rate. Ideally, the sampling rate should be at least 2 x as fast as the highest 
            frequency of your signal (theorem of Shannon). Usually, we sample the signal at 
            10 kHz. If you don&#39;t sample fast enough, you may see phantom frequencies in your 
            signal (due to undersampling). This also mean that even if you are not 
            interested in very high frequencies, if your source signal contains high 
            frequencies, you need to filter them using an analog filter before sampling them 
            with your A/D card. In practice, we filter the incoming data with a 3 kHz 
            filter.</li>
        <li><strong>How sensitive your data scale is</strong>. This is related to the fact 
            that the electrical signal is converted into a number which usually is an 
            integer. This means that if you data acquisition card has a 12 bits resolution, 
            data are encoded between 0 and 4095. If you are using a 16 bits card, data are 
            encoded between 0 and 65535. Since extracellular recorded spikes in insects are 
            typically in the range of 100 µV to 10 mV, we have to amplify the signal before 
            making the conversion, and store along the factor of conversion to be able to 
            convert these numbers back to a a voltage amplitude.</li>
        <li><strong>How many channels you want to monitor</strong>. DT9800 cards typically 
            monitor up to 16 channels which are sampled either sequentially or 
            simultaneously. As the sampling frequency is usually given by a clock located on 
            the A/D card, this may reduce the sampling per channel. Typically, we record 1 
            to 3 channels simultaneously so that it is not a problem for our application. As 
            the data are stored sequentially, generally,&nbsp; the data files contain data 
            which are interleaved: t1: chan1, chan2, chan3, ...; t2: chan1, chan2, chan3, 
            ..; etc. </li>
    </ul>
