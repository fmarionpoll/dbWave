    <P>Specifies the type of file you want to open:</P>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Database files (*.mdb). Database files are files storing information about a
            series of electrophysiological recordings. Each data acquisition file is storing
            descriptors along with the recorded data, and these descriptors are read by
            dbWave and stored into a database file. This file can be read by earlier
            versions of Microsoft Access (up to 2007).
        </li>
        <li>
            Data acquisition files (*.dat). You can also open data files from other programs
            with the extension *.asd or *.mcid. Opening such files will open a database file
            in which information read into these files will be stored.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spike files (*.spk). Files generated by dbWave after detecting and sorting
            spikes. Opening such files will open a database file in which information read
            into these files will be stored.
        </li>
        <li>
            Project files (*.prj). Project files contain a list of file names which can be
            subsequently opened by dbWave.
        </li>
        <li>Text files (*.txt). Text files contain only text.</li>
    </ul>

    <P><B>Drives</B></P>

    <P>Specifies the drive in which dbWave stores the file that you want to open. </P>

    <P><B>Directories</B></P>

    <P>Specifies the directory in which dbWave stores the file that you want to open.</P>
