    <h1>Detect Events</h1>
    <h2>
        Prerequisite
    </h2>
    <p>
        You need first to acquire data and store them into a datafile. From this
        datafile, you can then read the data, than you can display (and print) it, and
        perform different measurements and operations on it.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Measure parameters&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </h2>
    <p>
        Basic measurements are possible using a set of thresholds. Alternatively, you
        can export data to foreign programs as ASCII real value numbers.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Detect events such as spikes
    </h2>
    <p>
        The procedure implemented in dbWave is to manually adjust a threshold placed
        over the original signal or a filtered version of the signal (typically, we used
        a 30 points running median). When the signal crosses the threshold, it is
        considered a potential spike and data before and after this event are stored in
        a separate file (typically, we use 10 point before the threshold, and 50 points
        after it). Then, the threshold detection is inhibited (typically 15 points) and
        the procedure continues. The data which are stored are either the filtered
        version of the spikes or the origninal spikes.

    <h2>
        Detect occurence of electrical events
    </h2>
    <p>
        In many experiments, one needs also to detect the opening and closing of
        solenoids driving a stimulation (in the case of olfaction) or the lightning on
        or off of a laser in optogenetic studies. You can achieve this by using the same
        threshold approach but tell dbWave that it should store only the transition
        occurence along as a temporal event which will be displayed along as a blue
        line.
