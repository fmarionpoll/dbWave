        Create a database.
    </h1>
    <p>
        To create your first database, either click on the &quot;File new&quot; icon or go to the
        menu <span class="style1">F</span>ile / <span class="style1">N</span>ew... and
        select database. This will create a database which should be stored on your
        computer as an &quot;*.mdb&quot; file. As a rule, dbWave will use your connection name as
        the base of the database name and append a number which will be incremented when
        you create further databases.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img alt="Create new file" class="style3"
             src="Images/dlg_newfile.jpg" />
    </p>
    <p>
        This database will be initially empty. dbWave works by maintaining a database
        that collects information stored into primary data files (*.dat). You will fill
        the database by acquiring data with your data acquisition card, or by importing
        data acquired with another program if dbWave can read their format.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img alt="empty database" class="style2"
             src="Images/scratch_screeen0.jpg" />
    </p>
    The screen is organized in 3 panels. The central panel (or &quot;View&quot;) displays the
    data you have acquired and on which you work on. The upper panel display the
    properties of the file currently selected. The right panel deals with the
    database and allows you to select a subset of your records. On the top of these
    3 panels, you find a row of icons with text. These icons display which
    operations are currently available. Since you have no data file in the database,
    the only option available is &quot;Record&quot;. On top of this row of icons, you find
    another row of buttons which are used in the different sections of the program.
