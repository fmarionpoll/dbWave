                This is the input to which you generally connect your incoming signal. This

                Available values are GND, DC, 0.1, 1, 10, 30 , 100 Hz. If &quot;GND&quot; is selected, the
                input signal is blocked (nothing will come from the outside) - it provides a way
                to check for the noise sources which affect the transmission of the signal
                between the amplifier and the computer. DC means that the signal is not
                filtered.

                This input is generally set to GND. Each CyberAmp channel is differential, which
                means that it has 2 inputs which are subtracted to build the final signal. The
                input to this channel is inverted. If you set this input to GND, then the output
