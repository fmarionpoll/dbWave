        Spike files</h1>
    <p>
        Spike files are files generated by dbWave when spikes are detected. These files 
        have a &quot;*.spk&quot; extension. They consist into a collection of snippets from the 
        original datafile from which spikes were detected.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each &quot;spike&quot; includes an array with the spike data waveform (typically 60 
        points), and additional descriptors such as the time of its occurence, and it&#39;s 
        class number.</p>
    <p>
        Spike files are usually stored along with data files. The name of each spike 
        file is generated by using the name of the data file and adding &quot;.spk&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
        One spike file can contain spike trains from different neurons or channels, as 
        well as stimulus on/off descriptors.</p>
