        Project file</h1>
    <p>
        A project file is a text file which contains a list of filenames (together with 
        the path). dbWave can import the files of this list either in a new database or 
        into a currently open database.</p>
    <p>
        Here is an example of a data file list that can be handled by a project file:</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="project file" class="style1" 
            src="Images/project_file.jpg" /></p>
    <p>
        From here, you can go to &quot;Tools&quot; and select &quot;Open files&quot;. The program will then 
        create a database, loop over all the files in the list, extract information to 
        store into the database, and open the database &amp; data files (or spike files). If 
        files in the list are missing from the disk, the project list will be displayed 
        with a question mark replacing the first letter of each missing file name.</p>
