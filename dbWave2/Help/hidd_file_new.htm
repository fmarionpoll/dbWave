        <li><strong>Database</strong> <blockquote>
            Upon creation, a database will be empty. You will be 
            able to add records either by importing data (or spike) files or by acquiring 
            data with a data acquisition card. The database will be saved as a 
            document with an extension &quot;mdb&quot; which means it can be read by Microsoft Access 
            (until version 2007).</blockquote>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Project</strong>
            <blockquote>
                Projects are lists of file names that you can write or import as text via the 
                clipboard. Project files are saved with an extension &quot;prj&quot;, but they can 
                be read by Notepad for example. dbWave can open the corresponding files as *.dat 
                or *.spk files.</blockquote>
