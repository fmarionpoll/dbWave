        This dialog box let you define how signals are acquired (at which temporal
        resolution), what they will become, and how the data acquisition will start. It
        displays 3 types of settings.
    </p>
    <h3>
        A/D card parameters
    </h3>
    <p>
        This set of parameters defines how fast you will sample incoming data. Usually,
        we sample each channel at 10 kHz. It also defines how data are displayed on the
        screen as consecutive sweeps (here: 1 s), and also how data are stored in memory
        (here: as 10 buffers of 1000 words). These parameters are critical if your
        memory resources are limited and if the computing resources are limited. It is
        best to have only dbWave running while acquiring data.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Data flow
    </h3>
    <p>
        This defines mainly how long data will be stored when you decide to save them on
        the disk. &quot;Continuous / limited&quot; was meant to allow the user to interrupt the
        acquisition on demand, but this option is not currently set. &quot;Duration&quot; defines
        how long the data acquisition bout will be. Usually, we perform 2 s acquisition
        bouts for our taste recordings. &quot;On-line&quot; display determines if data are
        displayed on the screen while acquiring data. &quot;Write to disk&quot; defines if data
        are sent along to the disk or not. &quot;Audible notification&quot; defines if a &quot;bip&quot; is
        emitted at the end of the data acquisition.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Trigger
    </h3>
    <p>
        These parameters define how the acquisition will start. &quot;Software&quot; means that it
        will start immediately after defining the saving parameters, &quot;Keyboard&quot; means
        that the program will launch a dialog box waiting for the user to press a key,
        and &quot;external trigger&quot; means that the A/D box is connected to a wire which will
        deliver a TTL pulse to star the acquisition (A/D TRIG).
    </p>
    <p>
        In this dialog box, make sure that &quot;software trigger&quot; or &quot;keyboard trigger&quot; are
        selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you hit <a href="content_2_1startfromscratch_2.htm">OK</a>, you return to the
        previous screen, if you hit &quot;<a href="content_2_1startfromscratch_3.htm">Channels...</a>&quot;,
        you will return to the amplifier settings dialog box.
