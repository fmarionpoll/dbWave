        Copy all files of the current project - dialog box
    </h1>
    <p>
        This procedure will copy all the files included into a project (database+data
        files) into a directory, while keeping the structure of the subdirectories of
        the original repository. It allows thus to store a given experiment in a
        convenient location, such as a USB key or another disk. You access to this
        procedure from the database menu, under &quot;Tools&quot;, &quot;Copy all files...&quot; (see
        <a href="hid_tools_transferfiles.htm">here</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        The only parameter needed from the user, is to define a target directory which
        will receive the data files and the database.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img alt="Transfer files dlg" class="style1"
             src="Images/hidd_transferfiles.jpg" />
    </p>

    <p>
        If you hit the &quot;...&quot; button, you will get access to a standard disk browsing
        dialog, which will enable you to select an existing directory or to create a new
        directory where your project will be stored.. You can also manually edit the
        directory to add one or several subdirectories levels.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img alt="Browse directories" class="style3"
             src="Images/hidd_transferfiles1.jpg" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you hit the &quot;OK&quot; button, the program will start the copy, by scanning the
        database to list all subdirectories needed, creating them and transferring the
        data files one by one, storing them in the new directories and updating the
        database which will be saved at the root of your target directory. The procedure
        can be interrupted at any moment by hitting the &quot;Cancel&quot; button. However this is
        not recommended.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img alt="transfer files" class="style2"
             src="Images/hidd_transferfiles2.jpg" />
    </p>

    <p>
        Please make sure that the target directory is empty. If not, the program will
        abandon the procedure.
