        This dialog box let you adjust how your data will be acquired and how much 
        amplification is present on each input channel:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Data acquisition card: 
            <ul>
                <li>Upper panel: number of channels, A/D card input mode and miscellaneous 
                    information (card name, resolution, encoding mode).</li>
                <li>&nbsp;Individual A/D channel settings (table rows 1 to 3): name, channel number and gain&nbsp;.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Amplifier (table rows 4 to 10): name of the amplifier, channel of the amplifier 
            used, gain of this channel, activation or not of a notch filter, IN+ input mode 
            (high-pass filter or GND), IN- input mode (high-pass filter or GND), and 
            low-pass filter. In this example, our data acquisition board was not connected 
            to anything.</li>
        <li>Probe (rows 11 to 12): name of the probe and gain of the probe.</li>
        <li>The remaining rows (13 to 15) display the resulting gain and sensitivity. Signal max/min (mV) 
            indicates the maximum amplitude that can be recorded 
        by the card on this channel. DT9800 cards can acquire data between +10 to -10 V (without amplification). 
            If the input voltage goes over this limits, the signal is clipped. If you use a total gain of 
        x10, the limits will be +1 V to -1 V. With a gain of x100, it will be +100 to -100 mV. 
        The last row shows how much resolution you have with these settings.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        In this example, we have decided to acquire data from 2 channels.</p>
    <p>
        If you hit <a href="content_2_1startfromscratch_2.htm">OK</a>, you return to the
        previous screen, if you hit &quot;<a href="content_2_1startfromscratch_4.htm">Sampling...</a>&quot;, 
        you will adjust the sampling frequency.</p>
