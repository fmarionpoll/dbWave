<h1><A NAME="AFX_HIDD_EXPORTDATAFILE"></A>Export Data Dialog</h1>
    <P>This dialog is called by the menu item &quot;File / Export data file...&quot; which is 
        available under the view &quot;Data&quot; (see <a href="hid_file_exportdata.htm">here</a>).</P>

    <p>
        <strong>Source file</strong>: name of file to be transformed/exported. It can be 
        either a single file, or the whole list. This dialog box just display the names 
        of the files without the path.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Export as:</strong> format under which the data files will be saved. 
        They will be saved into the same directory as the source file.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">

    <ul>
        <li><strong>dbWave</strong> is the genuine dbWave format. It might be useful if one 
            wants to extract a channel or to undersample the data. Each exported file will 
            have the same name as the original file, except that the prefix &quot;AW_&quot; 
            will be added to their name.</li>
        <li><strong>Sapid 3.5</strong> is the format read by a specific program (written by 
            Bev Mitchell) which had been designed to sort spikes from extracellular 
            recordings from insect sensilla. Each file name will be concatenated with the 
            prefix &quot;SAP_&quot;.</li>
        <li><strong>ASCII text</strong> is a simple text file, where data are saved; each 
            row is one sampling interval while each column is from a different channel. Each 
            file will be prefixed with &quot;ASC_&quot; and its extension will be &quot;.TXT&quot; (instead of 
            &quot;.dat&quot;). </li>
        <li><strong>Excel</strong> is a spreadsheet that you can read with Microsoft Excel. 
            The file will have the extension &quot;.xls&quot;. As Excel files had a limitation in the 
            number of rows, data which have more than 16384 rows are spread across 
            consecutive columns.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Save comments in a separate file:</strong> tick this option if you want 
        to store descriptors of each data file into a different file.</p>
    <p style="font-weight: 700">
        Export options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>all channels:</strong> export all data channels.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>single channel:</strong> export only one data channel. If selected, this 
                option will allow the user to select a given channel. This is useful if the data 
                recorded include additional channels which are not used for the analysis.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>complete file</strong> or <strong>from (s) t1 to t2</strong>: define 
                here if you want to export the entire recording or just a part of it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>undersample ratio</strong>: 1 to n - you can export either the raw data, 
                or you can undersample the data by exporting only 1 point under 2 or 10 (ad 
                libitum). Each point exported will be then computed as the average of 2 or 10 
                consecutive points.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Export</strong>:: transform a single file. A message box will be 
        displayed upon completion of the operation and the name of the file which has 
        been exported is removed from the dropdown list.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Export All:</strong> transform all files of the list.</p>
