        Install dbWave
    </h1>
    <p>
        In order to install dbWave, you need to run &quot;setup.exe&quot; with &quot;dbwave_setup.msi&quot;
        in the same directory.
        You also need to run Windows (XP, 7 or 8).
    </p>
    <p>
        <img alt="Files needed to install dbWave"
             src="Images/installdbwave_files0.jpg" />
    </p>

    <p>
        The installation process with check if a previous install of dbwave is present
        in the computer, and if the version you have launched is a new version, you can
        overwrite the previous install. Setup will install the program, a few dlls and
        the help into a directory c:\Program Files\FMP\dbWave (or
        c:\Program Files (x86) if you run a 64 bits machine).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            If you want to use dbWave to read previously acquired data /
            spike files, this is all that you need to do
        </strong>.

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td style="width: 348px">
                You have now an icon of the program on your
                desktop
            </td>

        <strong>
            If you want to acquire data, you have to connect your computer to
            a data acquisition card.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        dbWave is interfaced to DTOpenLayer, which is a driver made available by
        Data Translation to connect computers and programs to data acquisition
        cards. These drivers are freely downloadable from their site. If installed
        properly, you should find in your control panel, a DT Open Layer board with
        a list of the current data acquisition cards connected to your computer:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img alt="Dt Open Layers" class="style4"
             src="Images/installdbwave_dtopenlayers.jpg" />
    </p>
    <p>
        Check that you find this driver and that the card is active. In this example, we
        have connected a DT9818 card to our computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes, DT cards are equipped with a red LED which indicates that the computer
        has detected it. If the LED is not active, then dbWave will not be able to
        communicate with the card. Use diagnostic programs shipped with your card driver
        to make sure that your system is working properly.
    </p>
    <p>
        In our laboratory, our data acquisition setup also includes CyberAmp amplifiers
        which are programmable through a serial cable. DbWave is interfaced to them and
        can modify the gain and filter settings of these amplifiers.
