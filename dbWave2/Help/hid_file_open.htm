    <P><A NAME="hid_file_open" class="newStyle1"></A><B>Open command (File menu)</B></P>

    <P>
        Use this command to open an existing document in a new window.  You can select
        and open multiple documents at once.  Use the

        <b> Window</b> menu to switch among the multiple open documents.  See <A HREF="hid_window_all.htm">Window 1, 2, ... command</A>.
    </P>
    <P>You can open 4 types of documents: database, data, spike, and project:</P>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The preferred way is to open database documents (*.mdb).<blockquote>
                This database is expected to contain a defined set of tables and records as
                generated by dbWave. It contains a list of file names and paths, and descriptors (which stimulus, which insect, etc). If this database does not have
                the proper format, opening such a file will fail. Usually, *.mdb files are
                stored under the directory &quot;My Documents\My dbWave Files&quot; but they can be stored
                by the user together with data files elsewhere.
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            Data files (*.dat).<blockquote>
                Data files are generated by dbWave each time a stretch of data is acquired.
                This file has a proprietary format but dbWave can read (or import) some other
                formats generated by other programs. Each time you select a single data file, it
                will generate a corresponding mdb file with a single record. If you select
                multiple datafiles, a single database should be created. A data file contains
                data acquired by a data acquisition card together with a header describing the
                data and the conditions of the data acquisition. This header is used to store
                information for the database.
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>
            Spike files (*.spk).
            <blockquote>
                Spike files are generated by dbWave when you detect spikes. It contains excepts
                from the data files which constitute spike records. Each spike (or spike record)
                contains an array of consecutive data points (for ex.60 points) and descriptors
                (time of occurence, filter mode, class number). Spike files are generally
                stored in the same directory as the data files they come from.
            </blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>Project files (*.prj)</li>.
        <blockquote>
            Project files are text files containing a list of filenames. They are used to
            open a series of datafiles, for example when exporting a list of files from
            Excel.
        </blockquote>
    </ul>

    <P>
        You can create new documents (*.mdb, *.prj) with the <A HREF="hid_file_new.htm">New command</A>.
        To create new data files (*.dat), you need to create first a database file and
        have a data acquisition card (from Data Translation) connected to your computer.
        Spike files (*.spk) are created when you detect spikes from data files.
