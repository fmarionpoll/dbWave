<h1>Record signals</h1>
    <p>In order to record signals, you need to connect your computer to a data acquisition card and to a signal acquisition setup adapted to your preparation. 
    </p>
       
    <p>In order to record from taste or olfactory sensilla, you need to derive signals from a grounded insect with a microelectrode connected to a probe and to an amplifier.</p>
    <p>To record data, you will need to define a few parameters:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data acquisition parameters of the data acquisition card:<ul>
            <li>how many channels</li>
            <li>sampling rate per channel</li>
            <li>amplification factor on the card (DT cards can amplify signals from x1 to x8) 
                for each channel. Typically: x1.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Amplifier settings for each channel:<ul>
            <li>Amplification gain </li>
            <li>Low pass filter settings (typically 2800 Hz).</li>
            <li>High pass filter settings (from DC to 10 Hz typically).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Pre-amplifier parameters:<ul>
            <li>amplification gain</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These parameters will be used to convert the data acquired by your board into 
        real number by a simple formula: voltage = (16 bits number)* 20 V / (A/D gain * 
        amplifier gain * preampli gain).</p>
    <p>
        You will also need to define:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>during how long data will be recorded and saved on disk</li>
        <li>how the data acquisition bout should stard (immediately, after pressing a key, 
            or when detecting a TTL pulse)</li>
        <li>and a few other parameters which describe the experiment and the content of that 
            data acquisition bout.</li>
    </ul>
