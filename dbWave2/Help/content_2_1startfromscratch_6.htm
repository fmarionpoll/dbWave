        Start recording</h1>
    <p>
        The acquisition will start immediately after exiting the file saving dialog box 
        or not, depending of your trigger selection. During the acquisition, the screen 
        is continuously updated (or not if you have deselected the corresponding 
        option). You cant hit the &quot;stop&quot; button at any time to interrupt the data 
        acquisition. You can also change the vertical display resolution on the fly, by 
        hitting the upper right button (in the shape of a magnifying glass) and moving 
        the vertical scrollbar. If you hit the button just underneath the magnifying 
        glass button, then moving the scrollbar will move the curve up or down (change 
        the position of 0 mV).</p>
    <p>
        On the central screen, you see here a white stripe, while actually, on a real 
        screen, the entire screen is white. This is due to the capture screen program 
        which enabled us to take a snapshot. What you see here is the display of 2 of 
        the 10 acquisition buffers defined previously.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="during acquisition" class="style9" 
            src="Images/scratch_acquisition.jpg" /></p>
    <p>
        At the end of the acquisition bout, dbWave displays a dialog box asking you to 
        validate or not the file. If you hit yes, or do nothing during 4 s, data are 
        added to the database. </p>
    <p>
        <img alt="validate record" class="style8" 
            src="Images/scratch_validate_record.jpg" /></p>
    <p>
        The upper panel is updated with the information you have entered for the 
        database (and into the data file):</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="upperpanel" class="style6" 
            src="Images/scratch_upperpanel.jpg" /></p>
    <p>
        And the upper row of icons now let you access to the different sections of the 
        program: &quot;Database&quot;, &quot;Data&quot; and &quot;Detect&quot;.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="upper band" class="style7" 
            src="Images/scratch_band2.jpg" /></p>
    <p>
        You should now hit &quot;<a href="content_2_1startfromscratch_7.htm">Database</a>&quot;.</p>
